# Restoration

It is a top-down Zelda-like game that needs to find its own identity.

Idea of the game:
 - Open the gate of the castle by collecting the necessary items hidden in the map

Current status:
- A top-down engine without actual game content (placeholders).

## Build and run.

The game comes as a simple web app. To play it, start a web server in the game directory and connect to it with your browser.
If you have Python installed, open a terminal in the repository main directory (the one containing the index.html file) and
type

```
python -m http.server 1234
```

Then open a browser and go to the URL ``http://localhost:1234``.
